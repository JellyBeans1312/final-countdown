# final-countdown

### Description
Final Countdown is the last project assigned by Turing School Of Software and Design. A user is able to find synonyms for a word they search. The synonyms are clickable - and when one is clicked, it displays the synonyms for that new word. This really tackles the problem of not knowing synonyms for words. The goal in this project wasn't anything complex, but we did have to build this application in a framework that was not taught to us to represent what a take home code challenge might be like. 

### Technologies Utilized
1. Vue.js

#### Future Iteration Technologies
1. Jest / Enzyme for testing
